# Examples

Our examples are stored as Jupyter notebooks in the [examples](https://github.com/lanl/JuliQAOA.jl/tree/main/examples) folder on GitHub. They include:

- [`good_average_angles`](https://github.com/lanl/JuliQAOA.jl/blob/main/examples/good_average_angles.ipynb): 
    find a set of angles for MaxCut which, on average, work well for [$G(n,p)$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős–Rényi_model) graphs.
- [`maxcut_kconst`](https://github.com/lanl/JuliQAOA.jl/blob/main/examples/maxcut_kconst.ipynb): test performance on MaxCut constrained to a particular Hamming weight.
